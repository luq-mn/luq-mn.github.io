            About the coding I do

        <h2>languages</h2>
        <p>
            Since actively coding in 2023, I have learned a handful of languages.
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            For the web, backend (I love <b>Node.js</b>), and games!
        </p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>
            My language of choice for <b>Discord bot development</b> (using <a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord">Pycord</a>),
            <b>data analysis</b>, <b>AI/machine learning</b>, and those projects where the language does not matter.
            I also use Python for quantum computer programming using <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit">Qiskit</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Go</h3>
        <p>
            I only adopted Go in <b>summer 2024</b>, but it has been clear since then to make Go my compiled language of choice.
            Certain quirks in Go will make you feel like you wanna throw yourself out the window, but once you figured it out,
            you will be fine - maybe. Go is also really <b>strict</b>, your code would not run/compile even if something you imported was not
            used...
        </p>

        <h3>x86 Assembly</h3>
        <p>
            It is indeed hard, but I just like it for the fun. Not exactly that good at it, but I know enough to write
            without a hassle. Recommended for the curious.
        </p>

        <h3>C</h3>
        <p>
            C is ancient. I do not prefer to use C, but it is used sometimes - typically with my x86 assembly projects to
            allow for more advanced functionality.
