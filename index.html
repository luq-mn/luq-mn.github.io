        <h2>a bit about myself</h2>
        <p>
            Born and raised in <b>Malaysia</b>, by a tech entrepreneur dad and a housewife (with a CS degree).
            Apart from programming, my other passions/interests include <b>economics</b>, <b>geopolitics</b>, <b>business development</b>,
            <b>drawing</b>, <b>architecture</b> and <b>writing</b>. Typically, I dont find much reason to use my
            personal gadgets - its more of a distraction really, and I rarely play video games.
        </p>

        <p>
            Coding is and always will be just a <b>hobby</b>. It is something I enjoy and love doing,
            but not exactly what I will full-time or as a career.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main quest is to serve god, start a <i>Fortune 500</i> company and make it to the top 10 <i>Forbes Billionaire</i> list,
            and like any other sane human - to be loving, loved and cherished.
            I picked up coding because I get to create whatever I want (most of the time), and therefore,
            come up with my own solutions and offerings to certain issues/problems. I draw more than I write code.
        </p>

        <h2>this website</h2>
        <p>
            It appears like every programmer in this world has a portfolio website or something similar.
            I have always wanted to have one, but never really got around to it.
            Settled on good old <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JS</b> :D
